1. com.fix.parser.FixParser is the API for parsing different types of FIX message.

2. For illustrating purpose, only NewOrderSingle is included here as an example.  Parser for other types of FIX message will be following the same paradigm.

3. com.fix.util.bytes and com.fix.util.math is referenced from a side-project developed by @Tom Haoyuan Chen. The implementation is aimed at providing a solution for arithmetic calculation focusing on zero-gc and decimal-place precision.
